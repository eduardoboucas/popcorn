description: "Household members should stay in another room or be separated from the patient as much as possible. Household members should use a separate bedroom and bathroom, if available. \r\nProhibit visitors who do not have an essential need to be in the home. \r\nHousehold members should care for any pets in the home. Do not handle pets or other animals while sick.  For more information, see COVID-19 and Animals. \r\nMake sure that shared spaces in the home have good air flow, such as by an air conditioner or an opened window, weather permitting. \r\nPerform hand hygiene frequently. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains 60 to 95% alcohol, covering all surfaces of your hands and rubbing them together until they feel dry. Soap and water should be used preferentially if hands are visibly dirty. \r\nAvoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. \r\nThe patient should wear a facemask when you are around other people. If the patient is not able to wear a facemask (for example, because it causes trouble breathing), you, as the caregiver, should wear a mask when you are in the same room as the patient. \r\nWear a disposable facemask and gloves when you touch or have contact with the patient’s blood, stool, or body fluids, such as saliva, sputum, nasal mucus, vomit, urine. \r\nThrow out disposable facemasks and gloves after using them. Do not reuse. \r\nWhen removing personal protective equipment, first remove and dispose of gloves. Then, immediately clean your hands with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Next, remove and dispose of facemask, and immediately clean your hands again with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer. \r\nAvoid sharing household items with the patient. You should not share dishes, drinking glasses, cups, eating utensils, towels, bedding, or other items. After the patient uses these items, you should wash them thoroughly (see below “Wash laundry thoroughly”). \r\nClean all “high-touch” surfaces, such as counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets, and bedside tables, every day. Also, clean any surfaces that may have blood, stool, or body fluids on them. \r\nUse a household cleaning spray or wipe, according to the label instructions. Labels contain instructions for safe and effective use of the cleaning product including precautions you should take when applying the product, such as wearing gloves and making sure you have good ventilation during use of the product. \r\nWash laundry thoroughly. \r\nImmediately remove and wash clothes or bedding that have blood, stool, or body fluids on them. \r\nWear disposable gloves while handling soiled items and keep soiled items away from your body. Clean your hands (with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer) immediately after removing your gloves. \r\nRead and follow directions on labels of laundry or clothing items and detergent. In general, using a normal laundry detergent according to washing machine instructions and dry thoroughly using the warmest temperatures recommended on the clothing label. \r\nPlace all used <a href=https://www.antsppe.com/en/prolist/25-1.html>disposable gloves</a>, <a href=https://www.antsppe.com/en/html/product/2020-3-25/130.html>facemasks</a>, and other contaminated items in a lined container before disposing of them with other household waste. Clean your hands (with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer) immediately after handling these items. Soap and water should be used preferentially if hands are visibly dirty. \r\nDiscuss any additional questions with your state or local health department or healthcare provide \r\nWe strongly recommend you stay at home and put on mask and gloves (here is three types <a href=https://www.antsppe.com/en/pro/110.html>gloves</a> in the market: <a href=https://www.antsppe.com/en/prolist/25-1.html>latex gloves</a>, <a href=https://www.antsppe.com/en/prolist/26-1.html>nitrile gloves</a> and<a href=https://www.antsppe.com/en/prolist/27-1.html> Vinyl gloves</a>, any types is ok!) to protective yourself. \r\nIf you can't buy them at your local, you may try to order it online, such as: <a href=https://www.antsppe.com>ANTS-LINK</a>, i ordered some from them, it's good \r\ngood luck!"

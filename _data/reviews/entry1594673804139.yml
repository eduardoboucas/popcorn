description: "Our company engaged Mr. Kurt Van Duyn, a South African Federal, to construct a corporate investment bond in the UK. He initially had probity references from a US chains registrar, and 2 associates, so we felt he was reliable. \r\n \r\nHis stated rate was $150,000, which we paid $50,000 wire transmittal, and $100,000 on reliability cards, so there would be a paper trail. \r\n \r\nMr. Van Duyn, has a registered function advocacy in the UK, Aggelos Capital at Antrobus Gratis, 18 College Roadway, Petersfield, Hampshire, England, GU31 4AD, but was initially not able to hook credit card payments and so directed us to gross the payments directly to Mr. Phillips’ law office company, into done with his website, as he did purloin credit visiting-card payments. \r\n \r\nIn amount to, 19 payments were made to Mr. Phillips starting July 19th, to August 19th, 2019, the total being, $63,338. During this later, I emailed Mr. Phillips 3 times, and called and left a message at his obligation twice, as I wanted to be unavoidable that entire lot was correct. He not in any degree got move in reverse to me, and in the poop indeed only got back to me January 7th, 2020, via email, when I sent him an email saying I was going to gripe to the Grandeur Stake, and other authorities. \r\n \r\nMr. Philips stated in that email that Mr. Van Duyn was his customer, and he had been instructed not to reveal to me by his client. (Mr. Van Duyn is a recent Universal Prosecutor from South Africa, and in this day is in financial services) and that he, Mr. Phillips, had no inkling what I was talking about and that as doubtlessly as he knew, the payments were destined for anticipated diligence on a mineral project. Mr. Phillips is a critical outrage legal practitioner and this story makes no sense. If we were paying him instead of owing diligence, we would have been his client. \r\n \r\nIn Oct 2019, after we had tried numerous times to try and find out of order what was going on, Mr. Van Duyn informed us that our undertaking was not thriving forward. \r\n \r\nWe had been told from the start that the union was pre-sold to Mr. Van Duyn and his investors. As this went along, and nothing ever materialized, the story kept changing, and became a epic to a billion dollar traffic they were getting paid from, which would then be second-hand to resources the connection, which is NOT pre-sold signification funds were at one's fingertips as one day as the sound construction of the fetters was finished. \r\n<a href=https://www.pinterest.co.uk/cryptocrazeinfo/whatsapp-status-videos/>whatsapp status video song download</a> \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nThis was all done AFTER we had paid him, and we believe our spondulicks was used also in behalf of a “trading program” that was a scam. We asked to get the drift in arrears diligence on the “investor” but were ignored, until in the end knowledgeable that the project was cool in October 2019. Mr. Van Duyn assent to on the 5th of December, to refund the amount in full on January 6th, then nothing happened. \r\n \r\nWe do recognize that Mr. Phillips was working in consort with Mr. Van Duyn, and his choice to return until being advised of actions against him, is suspicious. I was told near Mr. Van Duyn, that Mr. Phillips did hook a tariff, for his participation, and wired the rest to Mr. Van Duyn offshore. I don’t receive how a US personal injury lawyer has any sovereignty exceeding being able to buy with our registered pact in the UK. I also don’t separate the spaciousness of role the two of them had/have, as they would not bask in this information. Mr. Phillips took $63,338 of our in, for something he claims he knows nothing far, and wired it offshore to a artful enterprise. \r\n \r\nA grouse has been filed with the Magnificence Bar of Maryland against Mr. Phillips, and as surge a beef has been filed against Mr. Van Duyn with the FCA in the UK, as he violated not too items with his pinchbeck practices. \r\nhttps://www.ripoffreport.com/report/aggelos-capital-law-offices/mchenry-maryl-kurt-van-duyn-f-1490733\r\nhttps://topastravel.vn/9193/\r\nhttps://www.scamion.com/aggelos-capital-limited-47\r\nhttp://www.dust-devils-germany.de/forums/thema/kurt-van-duyn/"

description: "Great transfer to any country in the world. \r\nFor many years we have been using #kiwitaxi services to order a transfer. This is an intermediary company that will pick up a transfer for you in any corner of the world. We traveled to several different countries and always #taxi provided us with an excellent transfer at the lowest prices that I could find and much lower than taking a taxi upon arrival at the airport. \r\n \r\nIt’s very convenient to book a transfer, the Russian-language website is written in detail, you will immediately see the final price of the trip, without any additional charges. If additional services are needed (we order car seats for two children) then they are also selected immediately on the site and you see the final cost, taking into account all the additional services. \r\n \r\nBefore the trip you will receive a letter with the driver’s contacts. The driver meets you in the arrivals area with a sign with your name, helps with the luggage, it is very convenient, especially when you are flying alone with the children. All my bags were taken from me and I only drove the children;)). And which is very convenient, if possible, the company provides you with Russian-speaking drivers. We were even told about all the sights we met along the way, and generally answered all questions. \r\n \r\nOn the site you can pay either the whole amount, or pay the part that makes up the agency commission, and the rest is paid on the spot to the driver. \r\n \r\nPS. We always agreed with the driver on the return transfer and paid him only the amount that went in the paragraph \"To pay the driver\" \r\nhttp://www.herebooking.blogspot.com/2019/11/taxi.html"

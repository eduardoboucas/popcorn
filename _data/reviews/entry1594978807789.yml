description: "Tasmanian starts smokers rights party to save Tasmanian tobacco industry\n\nIt said it was important that Australia adopt policies which were fair, transparent and predictable to ensure a fair competition outcome for smokers.\n\n\n\"That's why we introduced the Tobacco Control Promotion Act 2013 which took aim at the unfair market in tobacco advertising, through greater transparency on price reductions and greater transparency on what type of advertising was being sold.\n\n\n\"It's also why we introduced legislation, as part of that, to set up a National Tobacco Strategy, to ensure there is proper oversight into tobacco advertising, regulation and taxation.\n\n\n\"That strategy will help keep smoke-free areas in Australia cleaner, and also give us greater clarity as to what we should be focusing on in terms of the number of smoke free areas in Australia.\n\n\n\"We've also committed to reduce the risk to public health and reduce the risks of cancer by improving the health of our tobacco free communities, and ensuring we ensure that the tobacco industry doesn't profit from harmful smoking practices.\" \r\n<a href=https://www.thesilkwrap.com/>예스카지노</a>\r\n \r\n \r\n<a href=https://www.webix3.com/>카지노사이트</a>"

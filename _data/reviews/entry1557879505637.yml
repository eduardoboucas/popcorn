It is in many respects the city of extremes where winter means warmth, modern meets the traditional, where ballet holds conversations with street art. Today it is the cultural, political, and business seat of modern Russia. \r\n \r\nFirst mentioned about a millennium ago, Moscow wears its ancient origins with pride and humility. \r\nThe magic the city is known for has to be at least in part attributed to its colossal history. The centuries of art, architecture, \r\nscience, war, upheaval all combined to make Moscow the buzzing 12 million people metropolis that it is today. \r\nhttps://pradiz.com/tours/moscow - Moscow Tours \r\n<a href=https://pradiz.com/tours/moscow>Moscow Tours</a>"

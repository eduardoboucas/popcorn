description: "Best CBD Oil for Sleep, Anxiety, Pain, and Insomnia – Our Picks and Buyer’s Guide \r\nLAST UPDATED ON OCTOBER 30, 2018 \r\nOUR REVIEW PROCESS \r\n \r\n \r\nTuck’s mattress and sleep product recommendations are based on more than 300,000 verified customer experiences and our team’s exhaustive testing procedure.

You can rest assured, when you’re ready to buy, the product you pick meets Tuck’s lofty standards. \r\nThis research is supported by you, our readers, through our independently chosen links, which earn us a commission. Read more about how we’re supported here. \r\nQUICK SUMMARY \r\nCannabidiol, or CBD for short, is a phyto-cannabinoid found in cannabis plants. However, it does not cause the same psychoactive effects as other naturally occurring cannabinoids (such as tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC). CBD induces feelings of sleepiness and tranquility, making it suitable for insomnia and other sleep disorders; CBD can be used to alleviate symptoms of epilepsy, diabetes, and anxiety disorders, as well. Legality is an issue for some; all 50 states have laws governing the sale, possession, and use of CBD, and they vary significantly (see the table below for a full analysis). \r\n \r\nThe extract known as CBD oil sold in the U.S. falls into one of two categories. Crystalline isolate exclusively contains CBD, as other cannabinoids have been removed; full spectrum oil, on the other hand, retains THC and other cannabinoids, and is only sold in states where marijuana use has been legalized. CBD oil can be consumed several different ways, including ingested capsules and food products, vaporizing, tinctures, and topical creams. The soporific effects of CBD oil are linked to its concentration; low-concentration oils will produce minimal effects, while high-concentration oils will produce strong effects. \r\n \r\nThis guide will discuss the benefits of CBD oil for people with insomnia and other sleep disorders. Below you will find our picks for the top six brands selling CBD oils today. Our choices are based on verified customer and owner experiences, as well as intensive product research and analysis. \r\n \r\nBest CBD Oils <a href=http://www.hondabigsale.com/the-hidden-truth-about-top-cbd-oil-tinctures-38.html>cbd rich hemp oil benefits</a> \r\nEditor’s Pick – CBDistillery \r\nHighest Quality – Green Roads \r\nBest Value – cbdMD \r\nBest Customer Experience – Fab CBD \r\nBest Concentration Range – NuLeaf Naturals \r\nBest Non-THC CBD Oil – Kat’s Naturals \r\nHOW WE DECIDED \r\n<a href=https://eventmanagementpuri.com/the-true-meaning-of-optimal-choice-cbd-28/>cbd pills benefits</a> \r\n \r\n106 CBD oils considered –– 130 hours of research –– 7 sleep experts consulted \r\nBest CBD Oils for Sleep, Anxiety, Pain, and Insomnia – Tuck's Top 6 Brands \r\nCBDistillery – Editor's Pick \r\n \r\n \r\nHIGHLIGHTS \r\nFull spectrum and isolate-based oils \r\nTinctures, capsules, topicals, vapes, and suppositories \r\nVarying concentrations (150mg to 5,000mg) \r\nOur Editor’s Pick is the tincture from CBDistillery.

Unlike other cannabinoids — namely tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC — CBD does not produce any psychoactive effects, and will actually counteract these effects to a degree. CBD will induce feelings of sleepiness; for this reason, it can be an effective soporific for people who struggle to fall and/or remain asleep due to insomnia and other sleep disorders. \r\n \r\nCBD can enter the body in many ways, including as an oil extract. This guide will discuss how CBD oils help induce sleep in users, explore safety and legal concerns associated with these products, share some tips for first-time buyers, and list our picks for the top CBD oils for sleep that are sold today. \r\n \r\nPlease note: CBD oil derived from marijuana is subject to stricter state and federal laws than oil derived from hemp. As a result, the former is more difficult to legally obtain in certain parts of the U.S. than the latter. For this reason, our recommendations in this guide will exclusively focus on hemp-based CBD oils. \r\n \r\nWhat Is CBD Oil? \r\nFirst, a disclaimer: While we at Tuck.com strive to provide information that will make our readers sleep better, our guides should never replace the recommendations of a licensed physician. Before trying CBD oil for the first time, please consult your doctor to ensure this product is right for you. \r\n \r\nCBD is naturally occurring, and is among the largest cannabinoids found in hemp and marijuana. Some studies have revealed that CBD represents more than 40% of the hemp plant’s extract. \r\n \r\nThe human body also produces cannabinoids, known as endocannabinoids, in a bodily system known as the endocannabinoid system (or ECS). The ECS promotes homeostasis by regulating a wide range of functions, including motor skills, mood, appetite, and sleep. As we age, our ECS produces fewer endocannabinoids; they may also decrease due to physical injury or disease. Replenishing depleted endocannabinoids with phytocannabinoids like CBD can help restore balance to the body. \r\n \r\nAs a rule, CBD oil extracted from hemp will contain no more than 0.3% THC and have minimal, if any, psychoactive effects; when extracted from cannabis, CBD oil may contain as much as 30% THC — and carry potentially strong psychoactive effects. \r\n \r\nCBD oils extracted from hemp generally fall into one of the following two categories: \r\n \r\nCBD CLASS\tEXTRACTION METHOD\tTHC CONTENT\tAPPEARANCE\tDRUG TEST RISK? \r\nCrystalline Isolate\tOil is extracted from cannabis plant, then allowed to cool; this isolates the CBD from other cannabinoids \r\nThe oil forms crystals and is crushed into a powder\tNone\tWhite and twinkly\tNo \r\nFull Spectrum Oil\tOil is extracted from the cannabis plant \r\nOil is not cooled, allowing it to retain THC and other cannabinoids\t0.3% or less\tYellow and translucent\tYes \r\nHow to Use CBD Oil \r\nCBD oil can be consumed in several different ways. These include: \r\n \r\nCapsule: CBD oils may be manufactured as small capsules that are orally ingested. \r\nEdible: CBD oils may be stirred into food or drinks, or baked into different dishes. One thing to keep in mind: CBD has a boiling point of roughly 350 degrees Fahrenheit (176.6 degrees Celsius), and exceeding this temperature may diminish the oil’s therapeutic effects. \r\nTincture: Another form of oral CBD oil ingestion is the tincture, often used as a food additive. Tinctures are sold in dropper bottles; most users place one or two drops beneath their tongue for several minutes in order to experience the full effects. \r\nVapor: CBD oil can be vaporized using aptly named vaporizer pens. \r\nTopical: This form of CBD oil is applied directly to the skin; it has the consistency of lotion. \r\nSuppository: Select manufacturers offer CBD suppositories that are inserted into the rectum. \r\nCBD oil may be unscented (‘natural’) or manufactured in different flavors, such as peppermint, vanilla, lavender, and cinnamon. In addition to humans, pets with chronic pain issues can also benefit from CBD oil tinctures. Non-THC and full spectrum pet CBD options are available from many manufacturers. \r\n \r\nThe vast majority of CBD oils come in bottles measuring either 15 milliliters (mL), or 0.5 ounces; or 30 mL, or 1 ounce. However, CBD concentration is more important than bottle size. Concentration refers to the ratio of hemp oil solution (measured in mL) compared to the amount of CBD cannabinoid (measured in milligrams, or mg). A 15-mL bottle may contain 100 mg of CBD, 300 mg, 500 mg, or more. The higher the mg amount, the stronger the CBD oil will be. For this reason, the ‘mg’ measurement is also referred to as the oil’s strength; i.e., 400-mg oil might be called 400-strength oil. \r\n \r\nHow much CBD oil you should take largely depends on your bodyweight, as well as the desired effects. The next table breaks down the effects of different doses based on these two factors. Always consult your physician to determine the best dosage for you. \r\n \r\nWEIGHT GROUP\tRECOMMENDED DOSAGE FOR MILD EFFECTS\tRECOMMENDED DOSAGE FOR MODERATE EFFECTS\tRECOMMENDED DOSAGE FOR STRONG EFFECTS \r\nLight (less than 130 pounds)\t11 mg or less\t12 to 14 mg\t15 to 17 mg \r\nMedium (130 to 230 pounds)\t18 mg or less\t15 to 23 mg\t18 to 28 mg \r\nHeavy (more than 230 pounds)\t23 mg or less\t24 to 30 mg\t29 to 45 mg \r\nCBD oil extracted from hemp — no matter how it’s consumed — works with the body’s ECS system to replenish cannabinoids and regulate homeostasis. The substance is also anti-anxiolytic, meaning it reduces feelings of anxiety — a common source of sleep problems in adults. For these reasons, hemp-based CBD oil can be highly beneficial for people with insomnia whether they struggle with sleep onset (falling asleep) or sleep maintenance (staying asleep). In addition to insomnia, CBD oil may lead to improvements for the following sleep disorders: \r\n \r\nSleep apnea \r\nREM behavior disorder (RBD) \r\nRestless legs syndrome (RLS) \r\nAdditionally, CBD oil can benefit people with other medical conditions. CBD oil may be prescribed for patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or Dravet syndrome, two rare forms of severe epilepsy; the medication Epidolex, a CBD oil oral solution, is typically prescribed in these instances. Many people with depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, and other mental health disorders have also found that CBD oil has a calming, therapeutic effect when they experience symptoms. Most medical experts agree that marijuana is not particularly beneficial for these individuals, as the THC can increase the symptoms of these disorders, making CBD oil a good alternative option. \r\n \r\nHowever, please note that the medicinal effects of CBD oil have not been studied extensively. While many medical patients claim the oils improve sleep quality and duration, more clinical trials are needed to determine how and why these improvements occur — and if they are applicable to all individuals. \r\n \r\nAdditionally, CBD oil is also associated with some negative side effects. In the next section, we’ll look at some health risks associated with CBD oil. \r\n \r\nAre CBD Oils Safe? \r\nCBD oil is considered therapeutic and low-risk for most users. However, CBD oil may result in the following adverse effects: \r\n \r\nInhibited liver function: The liver regulates the way different drugs are metabolized within the body; this process is known as hepatic drug metabolism. Higher-than-average doses of CBD oil can slow the hepatic drug metabolism process. As a result, users may not be able to process other drugs as quickly. This is particularly concerning for CBD oil users who also take prescription medications. \r\nDry mouth: As is the case with many other hemp- and marijuana-based products, CBD oil often leads to a condition known as dry mouth (or cottonmouth). This is likely due to cannabinoids altering receptors in the lower jaw that trigger salivation. In most cases, mild discomfort and stronger-than-average thirst are the only issues associated with dry mouth. \r\nDecreased blood pressure: CBD oil may incite a small drop in blood pressure immediately after it is consumed; this may also cause the user to feel lightheaded. These effects typically wear off within hours, although people who take prescription medication should check with their doctor to ensure the oil won’t counteract the effects of other drugs. \r\nDiarrhea: Diarrhea is a common side effect for people who take relatively large doses of CBD oil, and is linked to the substance interacting with the digestive system. Lowering oil doses often minimizes this effect. \r\nChanges in appetite: CBD oil may make users feel hungrier than usual, which is a common effect of most cannabinoids. \r\nLastly, as we’ve discussed, CBD oil tends to make users feel excessively tired or drowsy. This may be the desired effect. However, it’s important to note that operating a vehicle or heavy machinery after taking CBD oil — especially higher doses — can increase one’s risk of being involved in an accident. \r\n \r\nIs CBD Oil Legal? \r\nIn recent years, the legality of CBD oil and other products derived from hemp or marijuana has been a hot-button issue. \r\n \r\nBecause it does not produce psychoactive effects and hemp is not a controlled substance, hemp-based products are legal to sell, buy, and possess in all 50 states. However, the law is a bit more complex when discussing CBD oils and other hemp byproducts. According to the 2014 Farm Bill, hemp should only be grown and cultivated for academic research purposes. This means that, technically, any hemp-derived oil that is not grown for these purposes would be illegal — though this law is rarely enforced. To make matters more complex, the laws are somewhat unclear in certain states. Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky recently introduced legislation that would legalize all hemp products at the federal level, but this decision is still pending. \r\n \r\nThe legality of marijuana-based CBD oil also varies from state to state. The table below lists general guidelines for hemp- and marijuana-based CBD oil consumption based on different state laws. \r\n \r\nGENERAL DESCRIPTION OF LAW\tSTATES WHERE APPLICABLE \r\nHemp-based CBD oil is legal to buy, possess and consume for all \r\nMarijuana-based CBD oil is legal to buy, possess, and consume for adults 21 and over and approved minors\tAlaska, California, Colorado, District of Columbia, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon, Vermont, Washington \r\n \r\n \r\nHemp-based CBD oil is legal to buy, possess and consume for all \r\nMarijuana-based CBD oil is legal to buy, possess, and consume recreationally for adults 21 and over and approved minors; medical marijuana patients must be approved\tArkansas \r\nHemp-based CBD oil is legal to buy, possess and consume for all \r\nMarijuana-based CBD oil is illegal to use recreationally, but can be used by medical patients with certain conditions; no THC amount restrictions\tAlabama, Arizona, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Wisconsin \r\nHemp-based CBD oil is legal to buy, possess and consume for all \r\nMarijuana-based CBD oil is illegal to use recreationally, and can only be used medically if the oil meets certain THC restrictions\tDelaware (less than 7% THC) \r\nFlorida (less than 0.8% THC) \r\nGeorgia (less than 5% THC) \r\nIndiana (less than 0.3% THC) \r\nIowa (3% or less THC) \r\nKansas (must be 0% THC) \r\nMissouri (less than 0.3% THC) \r\nNorth Carolina (less than 0.3% THC) \r\nSouth Carolina (less than 0.9% THC) \r\nTennessee (less than 0.9% THC) \r\nTexas (less than 0.5% THC) \r\nUtah (less than 0.3% THC) \r\nWyoming (less than 0.3% THC) \r\nHemp-based CBD oil is legal to buy, possess and consume for all \r\nMarijuana-based CBD is illegal to consume recreationally, but is legally available to medical patients with a state-registered ID\tNew Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island \r\nThis leaves five states remaining. These states have more complex laws pertaining to hemp- and marijuana-based CBD oils. \r\n \r\nIdaho: Marijuana-based CBD oils are illegal to use recreationally or for medical reasons. The state senate recently introduced legislation that would legalize CBD oil, but the governor struck down this motion. This leaves Idaho’s legal status of hemp-based CBD in limbo at this time. \r\nKentucky: Marijuana-based CBD oil is illegal to use recreationally, but is available to medical patients participating in a clinical trial. Hemp-based CBD is legal. \r\nMississippi: Marijuana-based CBD oil is illegal to use recreationally, but is legal for research purposes when used to treat epilepsy. \r\nNebraska: Marijuana- and hemp-based CBD is exclusively available to medical patients participating in clinical trials. \r\nSouth Dakota: In South Dakota, CBD has been legally disassociated from other marijuana products. It is available to use recreationally and for medical purposes, provided the product meets FDA approval. \r\nLastly, it’s important to note that three states will be voting on marijuana-oriented initiatives during the 2018 midterm elections. These initiatives may have a bearing on the legality and availability of CBD oils. These states are: \r\n \r\nMichigan: If passed, the Michigan Marijuana Legislation Initiative would legalize recreational and medical marijuana use for all adults over the age of 21. \r\nMissouri: If passed, Missouri Marijuana Legalization Initiative would remove marijuana from the state’s list of controlled substances, legalize marijuana for recreational and medical use, permit marijuana sales, and authorize the release of all prisoners incarcerated for marijuana-related offenses. \r\nUtah: If passed, Utah Proposition 2, Medical Marijuana Initiative would legalize the use of marijuana for individuals with qualifying medical illnesses \r\nTwo other states, Arizona and Nebraska, failed to garner enough votes to place marijuana initiatives on the 2018 ballots. \r\n \r\nThese laws are constantly evolving and the guidelines listed above should not substitute for legal advice. Before attempting to purchase marijuana- or hemp-based CBD oil, please review the laws in your state and, if still unclear, contact your attorney and/or state and legal representatives for more information. \r\n \r\nWhere Can You Buy CBD Oil? \r\nWhen purchasing hemp-derived CBD oil for sleep, you may be able to find products through one or more of the following establishments: \r\n \r\nManufacturers: Most brands that make CBD oil allow customers to purchase products directly from them. Their websites have online shopping areas where products can be bought and ordered. \r\nOnline retailers: Most CBD oils are sold through online retailers. These establishments tend to have the widest product range, and many offer free doorstep delivery. Online retailers also frequently post product reviews, allowing buyers to compare different oils based on customer experiences to determine which is best for them. These reviews can also be used to evaluate the retailer based on customer service, delivery, and product quality. \r\nPhysical stores: Hemp-based CBD oils are often sold over the counter at certain brick-and-mortar establishments, including health supplement stores and head shops. Physical stores give buyers the full customer experience, and service staff can often provide helpful recommendations. \r\nDispensaries: In states where marijuana is legal for recreational use, dispensaries are a common sight. They are much rarer in states with more restrictions. In states that permit the use of medical marijuana, hemp-based CBD oils do not normally require a prescription but marijuana-based oils do. Like brick-and-mortar locations, dispensaries offer more customer service. However, as noted, this may not be an option depending on the buyer’s state of residence. Also, CBD oil prices tend to be significantly higher at dispensaries. \r\nWherever CBD oils are sold, it’s important to inquire about the following variables before finalizing a purchase: \r\n \r\nExtraction process: The difference between a crystalline isolate and full spectrum CBD oil can represent a pass or fail on a company drug test, as well as whether or not the oil provides the desired effects. \r\nThird-party testing: Once a CBD oil is manufactured, CBD oil companies will often submit their products for third-party tests, which are conducted by non-company personnel to ensure the product is safe for public consumption and meets quality standards.CBD oils should always be accompanied with information about third-party tests; best practice is to avoid oils that do not supply these details. \r\nLab results: These fine-print details are often included with CBD oils to back up third-party testing claims. General rule of thumb: while the results may be indecipherable to laypeople, oils that include lab results are generally better than those that do not list this information. \r\nCost is another consideration. Most CBD oils are sold in concentrations of 300 to 750 mg, although this may range from less than 100 mg to more than 2,000. A good indicator of price-point is the cost per milligram. Low-cost CBD oils usually fall between five and 10 cents per mg; mid-range prices are 11 to 15 cents per mg; and higher-end oils cost 16 cents per mg or higher. Given these varying per-milligram costs, a bottle of CBD oil may be priced anywhere from $10 or less to $150 or more. \r\n \r\nImportant Considerations for CBD Oil Shoppers \r\nWhen buying CBD oil for the first time and comparing different products, here are a few variables to keep in mind: \r\n \r\nWHAT IS YOUR CBD OIL BUDGET? \r\nAs noted in the previous section, CBD oil prices vary significantly by brand. The best practice for most is to determine a per-milligram budget for CBD oil, as well as a maximum price for the entire bottle. For example, you might decide that 10 cents per milligram or less is a reasonable budget; and that $45 (for a 450-mg concentration, based on the budget) is a maximum bottle price. Also, if ordering online, be sure to include potential shipping costs. \r\n \r\nHOW MUCH DO YOU WEIGH? \r\nWeight plays a role in the effects of CBD oil, and bottle size should be selected based on how much you weigh. Let’s say you weigh less than 130 pounds and desire light CBD oil effects; this means that 11 mg or less will probably suffice per dose, giving roughly 40 doses from a 450-mg concentration. If you weigh more than 230 pounds and desire strong effects, then this same concentration will supply roughly 10 doses. \r\n \r\nIN WHICH STATE DO YOU CURRENTLY RESIDE? \r\nBecause marijuana- and hemp-based CBD oils are regulated to some extent in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, it’s important to consider state laws when comparing different CBD oil options. Also, state residence may indicate that fewer buying locations are available. \r\n \r\nDO YOU HAVE A JOB WITH DRUG TESTING REQUIREMENTS? \r\nIf the answer is yes, then full spectrum CBD oils may not be a feasible option due to their THC content; although these oils contain trace amounts of THC, this may lead to a failed drug test. Crystalline isolate oils, on the other hand, contain no THC and will not compromise drug tests in any way. \r\n \r\nDO YOU TAKE PRESCRIPTION MEDICATION? \r\nIf yes, please be aware of the counteractive effects CBD oils can have on the liver’s ability to process different types of medication. \r\n \r\nDOES THE CBD OIL YOU'RE CONSIDERING LIST THIRD-PARTY TESTING AND LAB RESULT DETAILS? \r\nThird-party testing information is vital for consumers; any CBD oils that do not supply these details should be avoided. Lab results are not as crucial, but may indicate a higher-quality product if they are included. \r\n \r\nDO YOU PREFER TO BUY CBD OIL IN A STORE OR ONLINE? \r\nBoth online and brick-and-mortar experiences carry pros and cons for CBD oil shoppers. However, it’s important to note that online sales will be the only feasible option in many states. \r\n \r\nWHAT ARE YOUR FLAVOR PREFERENCES? \r\nIn addition to natural, unscented CBD oils, many oils come in different flavors. This factor boils down to personal preference — although the flavor selection will be broader with some brands than others."

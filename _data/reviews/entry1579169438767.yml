  After watching the film 'Ida', the impression produced by this second film
  known outside Poland by Pawel Pawlikowski is that it is a commission in the
  shadow of his success and not a quiet and meditated work of which the author
  can feel proud father. Probably in Ida's creation the author easily spent five
  years of his life, in this one it is obvious that the script are some
  brushstrokes sketched on the basis of fused in black and label of 'A few years
  later' that slow down the rhythm and burden a story that in this case is
  conventional in itself but typical and not very credible. The first twenty
  minutes it seems that he was going to be satisfied with making a Carlos Saura
  type film about Flamenco, only that applied to Polish folklore, and to the
  specific time in which they were under the yoke of the Warsaw Pact, it would
  have been a worthy effort because both the music and the interpretations in
  that first part are really outstanding, but the melodrama enters the scene and
  spoils everything. A lost opportunity and a downturn in the trajectory of this
  author that we hope will give us much more 'Idas' than 'Cold Wars' in the
  future.

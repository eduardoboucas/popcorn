description: >-
  Edward Zwick’s “The Last Samurai” is about two warriors whose cultures make
  them aliens, but whose values make them comrades. The battle scenes are
  stirring and elegantly mounted, but they are less about who wins than about
  what can be proven by dying. Beautifully designed, intelligently written,
  acted with conviction, it’s an uncommonly thoughtful epic. Its power is
  compromised only by an ending that sheepishly backs away from what the film is
  really about.
rating: '5'

title: How Do Diode Lasers Work?
description: "The basis of a solid-state <a href=https://www.kelebeautystore.com/diode-laser-hair-removal-machine>diode laser</a> is, of course, the diode. Laser diodes can have different emission wavelength??most of them have between 405 nm to 808 nm. The diodes usually have TO3, TO5, TO9, or TO18 housings. \r\nChilling the <a href=https://www.kelebeautystore.com/diode-laser-hair-removal-machine>laser diode</a> is very important. Though typically installed in copper modules (Fig. 2), this laser copper module will not be able to distribute all heat that is generated by a diode if the power of the diode is more than 0.5 W (500 mW). It requires an additional heatsink. \r\nA copper laser module (Fig. 3) can be inserted into a heatsink. Once inserted, the laser copper module still might generate too much heat. If so, it will require a fan. Additional air blowing with, let??s say, regular fan with sizes 40 by 40 mm or 50 by 50 mm will help to cool the heatsink. As noted above, chilling the diodes is very important. A cooler module will extend the lifecycle of the laser. In addition, the laser will be able to put out more power."

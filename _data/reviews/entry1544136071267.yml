title: Donnie Darko
description: "# Modern Existentialism \r\n\r\nDonnie packs an existential punch, with some explicit messianic overtones from its connection to The Last Temptation of Christ, playing at the movie theater. Combined with horror genre, Donnie viscerally comes through to the watcher and forces them to deal with life, death, and the cruelty of a dark world. Who will save us in this passage of time? Donnie Darko? Cult followers know that in many ways this film has more questions than answers."
rating: '4'

The name is derived from the abbreviation and serial number of Roussel-Uclaf Pharmaceuticals. The RU-486 was approved for use in France in 1988 and almost immediately became the subject of passionate opposition by rights groups and homosexual advocacy by rights groups of abortions. Both sides understood that as the RU-486 is rapidly being called, abortion contraceptives can change the dynamics of abortion, making women relatively easy and privacy, in most cases without medical complications and ending early pregnancy. Invasive Surgery Procedures In 1995, an executive at Roussel-Uclaf formed a company called Exelgyn to obtain a patent. Approved for use in the UK in 1991, Mifegyne in Germany in 1999, and Mifeprex in the United States in 2000. \r\n<a href=https://mmv.kr>https://mmv.kr</a> \r\n</div>"

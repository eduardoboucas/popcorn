title: Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire
description: "This movie is bad. The whole beginning seems like you're watching it on a vhs on fast forward. Then somebody hits play for the yule ball. You sit through that nonsense for an hour, and watch the whole rest of the movie with the actual plot on fast forward again.\r\n\r\nOne star, would not buy again."
rating: '1'

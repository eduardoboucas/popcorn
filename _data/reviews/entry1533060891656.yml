title: Straight Outta Compton
description: "## Straight Outta Compton\r\nThe group NWA emerges from the mean streets of Compton in Los Angeles, California, in the mid-1980s and revolutionizes Hip Hop culture with their music and tales about life in the hood. \r\n\r\n### The Good\r\nThe moments that are specific to NWA are the few magical scenes in the film. The most notable is when, after being warned by the police, they play Fuck the Police in Baltimore, leading to officers storming the stage while firing guns in the air. In a time where officers continue to gun down unarmed black men, it’s a peaceful form of protest.\r\n\r\n### The Bad\r\nThere’s one scene in the entire piece that feels human. Everything else is mechanical, lifeless and droll.\r\n\r\n### Final Verdict\r\n8/10 - You should probably go watch this movie. Especially if you live in America."

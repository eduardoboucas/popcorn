  You know how Kick Ass was such a great film and then the second one was a bomb
  because we'd seen it all before? Well, guess what -- you won't have that
  impression at all with Deadpool 2. The jokes are funnier and the action is
  action...ier. What's more, we don't have to Wade through all of the back
  origin story so this film cuts straight to the chase. I rated the first
  Deadpool 9/10, and this one 8/10 because it is slightly derivative and the
  final scene goes on a tad too long, but honestly, if I'd seen this one first
  I'd have given it a 9.
rating: '4'

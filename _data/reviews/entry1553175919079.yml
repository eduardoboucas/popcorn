title: 12 Angry Men
description: >-
  Intense courtroom drama which has 12 very different people, all males,
  struggling with a murder case involving a young Puerto Rican boy that seems
  cut-and-dried. However, juror Henry Fonda does not believe it to be as
  sure-fire as it appears. He votes not guilty and what follows is a chain of
  events that will test the views, beliefs and thoughts of the other 11 members.
  Fonda is great, but Lee J. Cobb steals every scene (and that is not easy to do
  in a film like this). Ed Begley, Martin Balsam, Jack Warden, Jack Klugman,
  Joseph Sweeney, E.G. Marshall and John Fiedler are among the other individuals
  caught in a situation that is much more difficult than it appears on the
  surface. An excellent character-study that should be studied and embraced by
  all present and future film-makers. 5 stars out of 5.

Fortunately, injector recovery kits are available, inexpensive, and you can easily install them yourself. \r\n \r\nI bought mine for $ 2.5, and it contained everything I needed for 4 fuel injectors from my X18XE 16V engine in my 1997 Opel vectra 1.8i automatic transmission (yc 90470755). \r\n\_ \r\nHere is what is included in the package: \r\n4x caps \r\n4 top rail spacers \r\n4 lower rings (also called insulators or shock absorbers) \r\n4 high-performance microfilters \r\n \r\nO-rings, rail spacers, and shock absorbers are easily replaced manually. Needle covers need to be warmed up a little, and microfilters should be replaced by inserting a screw in a vice. All in all, a 15 minute job that will make your fuel injectors new. \r\n \r\nConventional injectors, unlike modern versions of gasoline and diesel engines with direct injection, very rarely fail. So do not replace them if you are not 100% sure that they need to be replaced. A repair kit and / or professional cleaning will bring them into working condition, like new ones, in the shortest possible time. \r\n \r\nSubscribe - comment - share - like \r\nCheck out my blog to learn more about DIY cars and content."
